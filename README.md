# Robotic Food Delivery System


This is an open-source project for a Robotic Food Delivery System, developed as part of the __EG2310 Fundamentals of System Design__ module, Sem 2 AY22/23, under the _Innovation and Design Programme (iDP)_ at National University of Singapore (NUS).

The project team, Studio 2 Group 3, comprises of Loh Yin Heng, Wang Bo, Jeanette Sim Yu, Hang Jin Guang, and Ananya Agarwal.

## Description
Our objective is to build a food delivery robot that seamlessly navigates through a restaurant, collects an order, and delivers it to the designated table. Our design is based on the Turtlebot 3 platform and utilizes ROS 2 Foxy as its operating system. We employ the MQTT messaging protocol for inter-system communication.

To achieve our objective, we have built a dispenser equipped with a keypad that allows for the selection of the table. Our dispenser is powered by an ESP32 microcontroller, which serves as the brain of the dispenser. This allows for seamless communication between the dispenser and the robot, and enables us to easily modify and update the dispenser's functionality.

<br>This repository houses the code for robot navigation, MQTT communication and dispenser functions.
You may check out our project report under the [/Documentations](https://github.com/yinheng996/r2table_nav/tree/main/Documentations) folder for more details on our robot and its mission.

## Important Files
* [disp_code.ino](https://github.com/yinheng996/r2table_nav/blob/main/ESP32_disp/disp_code.ino) - This file serves as the dispenser master script, responsible for powering the entire dispenser. It encompasses a range of functions including integration of the keypad, servo, and limit switch, in addition to the publisher code for MQTT. <br/>
* [limit_switch.py](https://github.com/yinheng996/r2table_nav/blob/main/py_pubsub_robot/limit_switch.py) - This file contains the code to be run on the RPi. It is in charge of publishing the limit switch status out to the remote laptop to let the remote laptop know when food has been removed from the carrier and to return to the dispenser so that it can take the next order.<br/>
* [r2tcheckpt_nav.py](https://github.com/yinheng996/r2table_nav/blob/main/table_nav/table_nav/r2tcheckpt_nav.py) - This file the master navigation script that we run on the laptop. It subscribes to MQTT and ROS topics and navigates the TurtleBot based on Table Number inputted on the dispenser. The main functions used to navigate around the restaurant setting is `move_til()` and `right_angle_rotate()`.  The important functions used to complete the task includes `connect_mqtt()`, `docking()`, `check_dist()`, `calibrate()` and `locate_table6()` <br/>
* [ESP32_test](https://github.com/yinheng996/r2table_nav/tree/main/ESP32_test) - This folder contains a series of C++ files that facilitate testing of the hardware functionality on the dispenser. Included are files to test the ESP32 blink, keypad, limit switch, MQTT publisher, servo and wifi setup.
* [r2factory_test.py](https://github.com/yinheng996/r2table_nav/blob/main/table_nav/table_nav/r2factory_test.py) -  This file contains a set of tests designed to verify the functionality of the TurtleBot. Upon execution, step-by-step instructions are displayed on the terminal for users to follow along.

6. Refer to our [/Hardware/Electrical Circuits](https://github.com/yinheng996/r2table_nav/tree/main/Hardware/Electrical%20Circuits) folder for the schematics of the circuits that we use to replicate our robot and dispenser system. <br/>
7. Refer to our [/Hardware/Mechanical Parts](https://github.com/yinheng996/r2table_nav/tree/main/Hardware/Mechanical%20Parts) folder for the fabrications and assembly that we use to replicate our robot and dispenser system. <br/>

__Important__: Please note that our project has been developed using Ubuntu 20.04.4, ROS2 Foxy, Arduino 2.1.0 and Python 3.6, as well as a DOIT ESP32 Devkit V1 Board and a Robotis Co. TurtleBot3 Burger with Raspberry Pi 3B+. As such, modifications may be necessary when using other software systems or hardware platforms.

### Setup

1. To setup your Ubuntu Machine, clone our repository into your Home directory. Compile the workspace. <br/>

    ```
    cd colcon_ws/src/auto_nav
    git clone https://github.com/yinheng996/r2table_nav.git 
    cd colcon_ws
    colcon build
2. To setup your TurtleBot, copy the `/py_pubsub` folder onto the Raspberry Pi. Compile the workspace. <br/>
    
    ```
    ssh ubuntu@<RPi IP address>
    scp -r <path to r2table_nav directory>/py_pubsub ubuntu@<RPi IP address>:~/turtlebot_ws/src 
    cd turtlebot3_ws
    colcon build 
3. To setup the ESP32, we will use the Arduino IDE.
    1. Open the code for the ESP32 in the Arduino IDE. This will be located in the repository that you cloned in step 1. In the code, make any necessary changes or modifications.
    2. Connect the ESP32 to your computer using a USB cable.
    3. In the Arduino IDE, select the correct board and serial port. To do this, navigate to `Tools` -> `Board` and select `ESP32 Dev Module`. Then, navigate to `Tools` -> `Port` and select the correct serial port.
    4. To upload the code onto the ESP32, click on the `Upload` button in the Arduino IDE and hold down BOOT button on esp32, release the button once u see "connecting" in the serial monitor.
    5. Once the upload is complete, disconnect the ESP32 from your computer and power it using an external power source. The code should now be running on the ESP32.
4. To setup MQTT X, launch the MQTT X Desktop Client
    1. After the connection to ESP32 is successful, click the `New Subscription` button in the lower left corner to add New Topics. <br/>
    2. Add the topics `docking` and `table_num`
## System check

#### For your TurtleBot
We need to test if the limit switch is connected to the RPi and if the RPi is able to publish its status using [limit_switch.py](https://github.com/yinheng996/r2table_nav/blob/main/py_pubsub_robot/limit_switch.py)
##### In one terminal
    ssh ubuntu@<RPi IP address>
    roslaunch turtlebot3_bringup turtlebot3_robot.launch
##### In another terminal
    ssh ubuntu@<RPi IP address>
    cd <path to r2table_nav directory>/py_pubsub
    python3 limit_switch.py
The terminal should start publishing the limit switch state, press and release the limit switch and check if the publisher updates the limit switch state.
If not, reboot your TurtleBot and repeat the TurtleBot system Check.
#### For your Laptop
We need to run a factory test on the TurtleBot from the Laptop to test if the laptop is able to communicate with the RPi and if all components of the TurtleBot is functional using [r2factory_test.py](https://github.com/yinheng996/r2table_nav/blob/main/table_nav/table_nav/r2factory_test.py).
##### In one terminal
    cd <path to r2table_nav directory>/table_nav/table_nav
    python3 r2factory_test.py
Follow the instructions printed on your terminal, and if everything works out fine, it means the system is ready to go.
#### For your ESP32
We need to run a factory test on the ESP32. <br/>
   Launch the ESP32 factory test scripts in our [/ESP32_test](https://github.com/yinheng996/r2table_nav/tree/main/ESP32_test) folder onto your Arduino IDE, then upload and run on your ESP32 module. <br/>
   Do this individually for each script. <br/>
   If your ESP32 module passes all the tests, it is ready to go.
#### For your MQTT X
We need to check if the MQTT is able to received messages from the ESP32. <br/>
   Launch the MQTT desktop client. <br/>
   Check for messages received from the ESP32 Publisher. If nothing is received, refresh the desktop client. <br/>

## Running the Code
A total of __4 terminals__ would be required to run the code, in addition to the __MQTT X desktop client__. <br/> 
Prior to commencing the operation, ensure that a stable WiFi connection is established and that all devices, including the ESP32, laptop, and TurtleBot, are connected to the same WiFi network. It is critical to verify that all electrical connections are secure, and all mechanical mountings on both the TurtleBot and Dispenser are firmly in place before initiating the operation. <br/>
__To ensure reliable and safe performance, it is advised to avoid any physical contact with the system during operation.__ <br>
